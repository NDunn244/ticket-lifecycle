<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<p>
Users will use this link http://localhost/osTicket/ that will direct them to this page shown below where they can submit a ticket, so IT support can login and handle the tickets.

In this example, Karen is creating a ticket, the help topic is "Business Critical Outage" because customers are reporting to her that they cannot access mobile banking.

Agents will be able to see live tickets in the agent panel. Queue managers will assign priority tickets to the appropriate agents as well as assigning proper SLAs.

<p>
In this ticket, you are going to set the priority level of the ticket, assign the ticket to an agent, and change the SLA plan. Set the priority level to high/emergency since the customers are currently having problems accessing mobile banking. The SLA Plan will be assigned SEV-A. You will transfer this ticket to someone in the System Administrator department since this issue is above IT support.

<p>
Once the ticket has been assigned to someone in Sys Admin to fix the problem, you can resolve the ticket.

Once you are done, go to "Closed" tickets, you can see the ticket you just resolved there.
